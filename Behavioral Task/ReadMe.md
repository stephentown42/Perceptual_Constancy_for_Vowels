# Behavioral Task

**GoFerret** 1.0.0 is the user interface used to control stimulus generation and presentation, as well as monitor animal behavior and log task responses. 

The task works by setting / reading values on the Tucker Davis Technologies Open Ex system using Open Developer libaries.

### Compatibility:
Note that this code was designed for Matlab before the 2014 changes to the graphics system. We've encountered problems since then running version 1.0.0 on versions of Matlab after 2013b, as well as on Windows 10. A revised version (GoFerret 2.0.0) has been implemented for Windows 10 and can run on Matlab 2014 or later, but this was not used for this project - please contact @stephentown42 if you need more recent versions.
