# Electrophysiology Data


## Peri-stimulus Time Histograms (PSTH)

The majority of analysis is done on time-varying firing rates of units, generated by binning spike trains. Data for firing rates is stored in .mat files [(e.g. PSTHs_Merged_14-May-18_09-35-31.mat)](https://github.com/stephentown42/perceptual_constancy_for_vowels/blob/main/data/ephys/space/)
