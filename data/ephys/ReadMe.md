## Peri-stimulus Time Histograms (PSTH)

The majority of analysis is done on time-varying firing rates of units, generated by binning spike trains. Data for firing rates is stored in .mat files (e.g. [PSTHs_Merged_14-May-18_09-35-31.mat](https://github.com/stephentown42/perceptual_constancy_for_vowels/blob/main/data/ephys/space/)), which contain two structures:

* **options**: includes the edges of the time bins used to generate histograms (nHistEdges), the time window used to assess whether units were responsive (respWind) and some less interesting information about source files, timing offsets and stack info used to generate the file.
* **S**: main results in nested structure with ferret/channel/site organization
